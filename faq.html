			 <p class="question" id="question0">Why does your hotel has the name "Scarlet Sails"?</p>
			<p class="answer">"Scarlet Sails" is a romantic novel by the russian writer Aleksandr Grin. This is the story about a girl from the small 
				seaport town who was told by a kind elder that one day a decent man of her dreams will come to her on a ship with red sails. Years were passing, but she held this expectation in her heart, even though her father told her it was a joke, and everybody had fun on her.<br/>
				One day, a new guy, a former prince, arrived to the city and fell in love with her. When he heard the story, he bought a ton of red matery,
				made sails of it, and attached them to his ship he was a captain of. Then he led the ship along the coastline and made a proposal to his beloved one.<br/>
