			  <p>Welcome to the Scarlet Sails Hotel is a state of the art accommodation. Although this Web site will do its best to capture some of the spirit of this fine establishment, it must be seen and experienced in person before it can be fully appreciated. Nevertheless, please explore all that these pages have to offer. They will answer many of the typical questions curious travelers often have and leave you with a taste of what you will find at our hotel. If it leaves you wanting more, may we politely suggest you consider a  stay with us the next time you travel.</p>

A whole new wing of the med rooms has been added, a new restaurant is now open on the premises, the activity center has been renovated, and the lobby has also undergone a face lift. These additions are like none other you have seen before -- even if you have stayed with us previously you might not recognize us now. We really spared no expense in this remodeling to bring you the most compelling and involving vacation stop you can imagine. When you need a real getaway -- mind, body, and spirit -- we urge you to consider staying with us at the world famous Scarlet Sails Hotel. You won't regret it and you won't forget it! </p>
